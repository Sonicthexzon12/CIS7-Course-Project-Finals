# Summary

the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of 
the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products that goes through 4 different paths:  possible paths, shortest path, 
lowest cost path, and longest path. 


# Details

What problems are you solving in this project?

·Finding the shortest path, the most low-cost trips, and determining using a simple path or long path.

What solutions are you implementing in the project? 

·The project uses STL-vectors and structures to define the edges and paths. It also uses sort to sort the order of city names, and permute and combine each route. 

Provide explanation of calculations and algorithm implementation.

· In the project, there are four choices to choose which paths the specialist wants to find, choice 1 is to give the specialist all the paths that can be used wouthout repeating any noted cities; choice 2 is to calculate the shortest path; choice 3 is to calculate the lowest cost path; choice 4 is to calcuate the longest path that the specialist might need to void.

What is the program objectives? Explain how your program is interacting with the user 
and its purpose.

·The objective of this program is to look for possible shortest paths, longest path, and lowest cost trips. The program lets the user choose to pick a simple path or a long path by showing possible routes in Riverside, Perris, Moreno Valley, and Hemet.

How is discrete structures implemented in the C++ program?

·Discrete structures used in the project is Grid path in listing 4 city trip routes and using Permutation.

What are the limitations of the program?

·The limitation of this project is that it can’t calculate the long paths when the user may need to repeat some cities.

Provide recommendation on improving the limitations of the program.

· The projects can use other STL containers to shorten and simplify the codes when I use the for loop and if statements to get the total distance for each path.

# Instructions
1. If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of 
the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products. 
2. Determine shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist.
3. Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, low-cost and shortest paths, 
including matrices, adjacencies.
4. Provide documentation that explains solution and programming approaches.
