Project: 
Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel

Summary:

the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of 
the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products that goes through 4 different paths:  possible paths, shortest path, 
lowest cost path, and longest path. 


Details:

What problems are you solving in this project?

·Finding the shortest path, the most low-cost trips, and determining using a simple path or long path.

What solutions are you implementing in the project? 

·The solution is using 2D arrays, and adding in vectors, strings, and edges to determine different possible routes in traveling through the Inland Empire Solar Sales.

Provide explanation of calculations and algorithm implementation.

·The main function which starts at Riverside we add different city trips (Moreno Valley, Perris, and Hemet) with the use of edges and vectors to move at the closest pathway (for example Riverside->Perris->Hemet->Riverside) then add the total distance of the trip travels. We have also created 4 algorithm choices using the while function to let user select which paths (Possible paths, shortest paths, lowest cost paths, and longest paths) in how they can reach to their destination.

What is the program objectives? Explain how your program is interacting with the user 
and its purpose.

·The objective of this program is to look for possible shortest paths, longest path, and lowest cost trips. The program lets the user choose to pick a simple path or a long path by showing possible routes in Riverside, Perris, Moreno Valley, and Hemet.

How is discrete structures implemented in the C++ program?

·Discrete structures used in the project is Grid path in listing 4 city trip routes and using Permutation.

What are the limitations of the program?

·The limitations are finding different location paths, the total distance of miles travel, and handling main function to fix up the output of the code.

Provide recommendation on improving the limitations of the program.

·We recommended on creating 2D array vectors and edges to help have a lower limitation on the program code in showing a row number of vertices for the start city and destination in an ascending order

Instructions:
1. If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of 
the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products. 
2. Determine shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist.
3. Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, low-cost and shortest paths, 
including matrices, adjacencies.
4. Provide documentation that explains solution and programming approaches.
