 2.     Case 1: Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel
·      Finding the shortest path, the most low-cost trips, and determining using a simple path or long path.
·      The solution is using 2D arrays, and adding in vectors, strings, and edges to determine different possible routes in traveling through the Inland Empire Solar Sales.
·      The main function which starts at Riverside we add different city trips (Moreno Valley, Perris, and Hemet) with the use of edges and vectors to move at the closest pathway (for example Riverside® Perris®Hemet®Riverside) then add the total distance of the trip travels. We have also created 4 algorithm choices using the while function to let user select which paths (Possible paths, shortest paths, lowest cost paths, and longest paths) in how they can reach to their destination.
·      The objective of this program is to look for possible shortest paths, longest path, and lowest cost trips. The program lets the user choose to pick a simple path or a long path by showing possible routes in Riverside, Perris, Moreno Valley, and Hemet.
·      Discrete structures used in the project is Grid path in listing 4 city trip routes and using Permutation.
·      The limitations are finding different location paths, the total distance of miles travel, and handling main function to fix up the output of the code.

Instructions:
1. If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of 
the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products. 
2. Determine shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist.
3. Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, low-cost and shortest paths, 
including matrices, adjacencies.
